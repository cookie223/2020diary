Saudi and Russia had a on-deplayed-on-again drama over the weekend and so did the oil price. 
New York state posted two days of slight declines in dealth toll (Sunday 4/5 and Monday 4/6). Trump and Cuomo seems to inteperate that
to a plateu and lightened. CA, OR and WA are sending away some ventilators to the federal to help with heavy hit places.
Most of my fiends don't really believe things are actually getting better. Testing in CA is still not up to speed. 
Death toll in New York drops is not significate. The number of confirmed cases is still high.

In other news, Boris Johnson got admitted into hospital over the weekend. Also seems to be in intensive care.
There was first news that he's connected to ventilation. Then news that the previous news is "Russian disinformation". 
Then news that he's actually in intesive care unit ready to be connected.
I think it's very likely to go worse and will be a blow to the sentiment.
