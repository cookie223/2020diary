s&p 2526.90 (+2.28%), nasdaq (+1.72%)

What a day for inlustration how the market trade on news headline. 
8:30 AM initial jobless claim came out as 6 million. Undoubtly a new record and double the 3 million last week which was a new record
and several folds of previous record in 1980s. S&p futures drops from +2% to -3%. Then Trump came out claiming on Twitter that he contacted
Russian and Saudi Aaibia and they agreed on a oil production cut. Oil jumped 30% on the news even though nobody knows whether it's true.
And the market basically set the tone for a moderate gain for the day. What a great timing. Trump should be marked as market manipulator.

During the daily breifing of the White House. Secretary Mnuchin was almost like begging small businesses to keep people on the payroll
and "hire them back". Federal goverment will start to provider loans that 100% forgivable for small businesses to pay their employees
(paycheck protection program) starting Friday. Let's see how that goes.

COVID-19 cases and death tolls are starting to feel like just numbers around what people are talking about. Market is also less volatile.
Most topics seems to be around entertainments at home now. I still feel more optimistic about getting back to higher level of economic
activity (like traveling) early to mid May.
