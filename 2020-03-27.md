s&p 2541.47 (-3.37%), nasdaq 7502.38 (-3.79%)

A turbulent day for the relief bill. One republican House representative almost objected to unanimous consent and got all representatives
to fly back to DC to vote. Luckily the bill passed via UC and Trump signed it 4 pm. In other news, Boris Johnson tested positive for
coronavirus, generating lots of memes as what you can expect quarantined people do.

The market still wraps as a great week even for the drop today. However I really don't believe there's a good reason to be optimistic.
As  they say, there are just more huge up and downs in a bear market (still a bear market for s&p).
