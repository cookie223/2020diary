Stock market rose a bit on hopes of reopening. The raise is not much higher than where future ended on Friday though.
Crude Oil June contract continues to drop (-6% to $12). USO negotiated with CME and had to roll contracts sooner and put much pressure
on June contracts. 

Reopening is definitely happening. GA is opening. CO is opening except Denver and Boulder. NY is planning to reopen and probably business
that won't attract NYC people to go.
