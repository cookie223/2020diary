## Why do I want to write this?

Just a few weeks ago, before everything happended, a friend in the FIRE community (Mei) posted a reading about what people were talking
before the 1929 great depression. We all think a recession is coming and wonder what would be people talking about just about that. 
Unfortunately we couldn't find much before 2008 recessio and the "perpetual prosperity" in the 1929 papers are quite relatable.

And then here we are with a huge demand shock by COVID-19, then the oil price war between OPEC and Russia, fastest bear market ever,
quaratine to "flatten the curve", a recession seems all but inevitable. Also human memory are supposed to be twisted towards what they
want to believe. I also want to add more about how market and people reacted and not just news from the internet.
So it would be better to write down what is exactly being told rather than relying on my memory a few years later.

## So what are people taking about?

I will have to recall a few weeks worth of news and just like I said last paragraph, I probably will recall what I believe to be important.
Take them with a grain of salt.

Around the time when SPX peaked at 2020-02-19 until, the top news in US are still mostly about democratic primary including the debate.
The COVID-19 situation still seems to be regional. Some companies issued warnings on earnings and market starts to be volatile around 2020-02-25.

Virus starting to take a hold on [Washington state with 29 deaths of the elders](https://time.com/5783771/coronavirus-us-cases/).
After super Tuesday on 2020-03-03,the democratic field drops to Bernie Sanders vs Joe Biden. 
Fed took the overnight rate to 1.00% - 1.25% on 2020-03-03. [50 bp emergency cut ahead of scheduled meeting on 2020-03-18](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Italy_coronavirus_lockdown).
The timing of this felt very surprising, at the time nobody expected action from the Fed before the scheduled meeting and the market
responsed with the huge drop in the afternoon session during and after the announcement.

Italy locksdown northern provinces early on Sunday 2020-03-08, then expendated the lockdown to the whole country late evening 2020-03-09.
Market starts to get crazy. We start to learn about 5% limit up/down for future indices and that 7% drop in SPX causes market-wide trading halt.
The 7% drop even came just a few mintues after market start on 2020-03-09 and 2020-03-12. At this point, we know we are observing
**unprecedented** history.

The next week felt like we simply can't keep up with the news. Every few minutes there are some "breaking news".
News OPEC+ failed to negotiate a deal to reduce production came on Sunday and caused the [largest drop in oil price in one day since 1991](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/08/oil-plummets-30percent-as-opec-deal-failure-sparks-price-war-fears.html).
On 2020-03-10, [WHO declares COVID-19 as a pandemic](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/11/814474930/coronavirus-covid-19-is-now-officially-a-pandemic-who-says).
On 2020-03-11, Trump announced [30-day traval ban from European countries except UK and Irland](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/11/814597993/trump-set-to-deliver-address-as-coronavirus-deemed-a-pandemic).
[Spain also went into lockdown, even more strict than Italy, on 2020-03-14].(https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/world/europe/spain-coronavirus.html)
On 2020-03-11, NBA suspend the season. On 2020-03-12, broward goes dark. Most concerts, events that require travel are already delayed
or cancelled by this time. The fear of financial distress in airlines, hotel, shale oil caused a -9.51% drop in SPX, bigest since 1987 (only to be 
passed again a few day later). Airlines and Shale oil indurstrials are highly leveraged and fear of coporate debt defaults are high.
Stock, bond and even gold are dropping.

Fed drop the overnight rate all the way down to 0.00% - 0.25% on 2020-03-15. 100 bp emergency cut ahead of scheduled meeting on 2020-03-18
and commited to various market operations. And the market responsed the next Monday with a historical [-11.98% drop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_daily_changes_in_the_S%26P_500_Index)
only drwaft by 1987 and 1929 percentages one day each. Partially thanks to the rally in the last 30 minutes on 2020-03-13 as Trump spreaking about 
providing tests and support from private sector companies that lifted SPX by almost 200 points and produced the room to drop.
Over the weekend [Saudi Aramco says "very comfortable" with $30 a barrel oil](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/16/reuters-america-saudi-aramco-says-very-comfortable-with-30-a-barrel-oil-cfo.html).
Saudi is said to have significately reduced prices for oil contracts in April after the current production cut agreement expires.
Oil prices continue to drop and reaches $20 a barrel later in the week.

Central around the world have been dropping rates, purchasing assets. Some significate fiscal simulation packages are also coming into place.
On 2020-03-17, [Spain is going to spend 20% of GDP](https://english.elpais.com/society/2020-03-17/spain-announces-200-billion-relief-package-against-effects-of-coronavirus.html).
On 2020-03-20, [UK goverment will pay workers wages](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-20/u-k-government-to-help-pay-workers-wages-during-pandemic?sref=rb2ZQ1iT)
(There are immediately memes floating around suggesting Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak should go to No. 10 Downing St next.)
Fiscal simulation package ideas has been floating around in US. So far smaller measures like student loan interest relief has been passed.
Federal paid sick leave and tax rate check of $1000 per adult are said to be included in a package to be voted on Monday.
My understanding of these simulation packages are to keep individuals and coprates afloat. There is absolutely no room for growth
and recession might only be avoided if we don't stay in contraction very long (less then 2 quaters for example).

[State department issued a level 4 - Global "Do Not Travel" warning on 2020-03-19](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/03/state-department-issues-global-do-not-travel-warning.html).
The website doesn't even have a global section and it seems like searching for country like UK doesn't show the accurate level.

So here we are, almost up to date. I will hopefully add an entry every day and have much shorter summaries.
