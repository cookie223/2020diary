The big news is not in the equity market though. CLK0 (Crude Oil WTI May 2020) dropped from $18.27 to $-12.33 and intra-day low of -$40.32.
Southern states are [reopening](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/georgia-elsewhere-south-governors-begin-lifting-coronavirus-restrictions-n1188391).
But the market is surely short sighted and all eyes on the negative price future contract that deliverys crude oil in May. It's a fun
thing to say "We are witness of the history". Earnings season is also on going and companies are abandoning their year-end guidance.
We are still in the mist and not sure whether reopening works, how bad the economy is.
