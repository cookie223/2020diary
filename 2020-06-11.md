s&p 3002.10 (-5.89%), nasdaq 9492.73 (-5.27%)

Nasdaq closed over 10,000 for the first time ever on 6/10 as [fed gave the dovish position](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/10/economy/federal-reserve-june-meeting/index.html).
However, the stock market had its [worst day since March](https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-stock-markets-dow-update-6-11-2020-11591853228)
the next day for no good reason.

The idea that the stock market is out of touch of the economy has been around for a good number of days.
I wonder if that's a good indicator that a crash is going to come eventually.
