Quite a few good news happened. OPEC, Russia, Mexico and US came to an agreement on oil production cut nearly 10% of global supply [source](https://www.investing.com/news/coronavirus/in-oil-market-sunk-by-coronavirus-giant-output-cuts-make-ripple-not-big-waves-2138209).
NY also seems drastically lower new hospitalization (50-80 per day from ~1500 per day). 
The market seems to be worried about the earning season. It is for sure hard to predict.
We also need time to see whether we are in deed in recession. March/April could either be absorbed in to positive territory, or 
can lead two quarters down.
