The market was generally up for the day continuing in the bull market territory. Also end as a best week since 1978 or something even 
as a 4-day week.
In the morning Fed expands corporate-debt purchases
and even go into junk territory. Even the new 6.6 million unemployment led the market up for a bit. The number of new cases and new
hospitalization are low. Even though death numbers are very growing higher but I think the public opinion is that that is a delayed indicator.
There are quite a lot of analysts saying we are already in a ressession and the bear has another leg down.
I more or less believe the coronavirus situation can be predicted to be ok. Economy-wise we will need to see what fed/goverment can do.
