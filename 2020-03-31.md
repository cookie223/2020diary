s&p 2586.88 (-1.51%), nasdaq 7700.10 (-0.95%)

End of Quarter. Headline: DOW plunged 23% in worst quarter since 1987.

Another not so interesting day. NY had 9k new cases overnight, NJ reported 2k new cases. Fed started new temporary repurchase agreement
for foreign central banks to swap treasury for cash. A new action for the fed and it is bascially acting like the central bank of the
world.

NYC and presumbly NJ still cannot really restrict how people are acting. E.g. 
[crowd watching USNS comfort](https://nypost.com/2020/03/30/crowds-ignore-social-distancing-rules-to-watch-usns-comfort/).
There is a bit concerning news that some workers at Wholefoods, Instacart, etc start "sickout" and limiting delivery capacity.
Rumors about lay offs are also coming but nothing too out of suspision.
