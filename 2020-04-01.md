White House taskforce briefing seems to be working on managing expectation that death could be tens of thousands. 
NY state says it could last 4 to 9 months. And Fauci seems to hint summer travel season won't happen.
I think those are a bit too pessimistic. I do hope market sees it that way and testnew lows.
ADP employment data is better than "expected". But most expectations are wild guesses at this point.
