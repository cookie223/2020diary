s&p 2939.51 (+2.66%), nasdaq 8914.71 (+3.57%)

s&p was once above 2950 while the fed was speaking. 2020Q1 US GDP -4.8%. Bloomberg survey estimate was -4% but recent news articles were
estimating around -6%. 
[Facebook earnings](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/29/facebook-fb-earnings-q1-2020.html) adds to Google's earnings after market yesterday signaling
that big tech companies are not suffering much. [The fed and gilead drug](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/stocks--dow-racks-up-gains-on-fed-stimulus-hopes-progress-on-covid19-drug-2155251)
also added to the good news. The [drug data](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/04/20/theres-more-to-gilead-sciences-remdesivir-data-tha.aspx)
, however, is not nearly as promising as it is intereprated by the market in my opinion.

Layoff news are coming from unicorn companies like [lyft and uber](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/04/lyft-lays-off-almost-1000-staffers-as-uber-weighs-big-layoffs/).
I do wonder whether tech can really stay out of this. Advertising spendings will probably show?
