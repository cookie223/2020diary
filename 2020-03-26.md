s&p 2630.07(+6.24%) nasdaq 7797.54(+5.60%)

A third raise in a row. If you are looking at Dow Jones, which you shouldn't, we are back in bull market again (+20% from lowest close).
Meanwhile there really isn't much data to be happy about. US is now the number one in number of confirmed cases. After passing Italy
yesterday, US passed China today with 83836 cases (John Hopkins source as of 8:56 PM ET). Initial jobless claim surged to 3.28 Million.
Highest ever since data being published 1967 and quadripled from previous high in 1982. I totally believe the market is just being a bit
carried away by simulus package or maybe a bit month end rebalancing act. So I bought more SH.
