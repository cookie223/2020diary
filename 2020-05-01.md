s&p 500 2830.71 (-2.81%), nasdaq 8604.95 (-3.20%)

Tech led the drop again. AAPL dropped after not issuing guideline. 
But [earnings grew](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/04/apple-reports-second-quarter-results/) so we could just have different
headlines if AAPL went up.

The concensus is probably the economy downturn is just beginning and no where close to bottom yet. But whether the market is
the bottom is another story. Most opinion seems to believe [the market will likely go back to March 23 low](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/will-the-stock-market-tumble-back-to-its-coronavirus-lows-in-march-about-92-years-of-sp-500-history-says-theres-a-good-chance-2020-05-01).
Some other opinion compared the current market with March 2008 when people belived monetory policy and fiscal policy would be enough.

I also believe the market will turn downwards again. I almostly existed all equity positions in all accounts but then realize
it's really hard to time the market and I'm currently not really close to fully invested at all.
