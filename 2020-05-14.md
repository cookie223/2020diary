Wednesday, fed is [not considering negative rates](https://www.wsj.com/articles/negative-u-s-interest-rates-dont-bet-on-it-11589470114).
Thursday, initial claims slows down to [2.98 million](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coronavirus-covid-weekly-initial-jobless-claims-may-9-155532542.html),
but worse than predicted 2.5 million. It makes me wonder how many people out there are still getting laid off.
Somehow the market finished a great run on Thursday, started around -1% and finished more than 1% up. Only possible good
news is that Jersey shore will be open for memorial day weekend (5/23-5/25). Maybe reopening is underway.
